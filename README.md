# 3-DOF-Robotic-Arm-Project

# Inspiratio for this project

I was really interested in the math behind inverse kinematics and wanted to begin by first working on 3 DOF Inverse Kinematics and then possibly increase up to 5 DOF.
I also wanted to apply the theoretical knowledge on electronics and circuits that i learnt in college into a project.

# Project Description

This project focuses on building a 3 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm using servo motors for each axis. 
The robotic arm is capable of performing basic movements such as lifting, rotating, and grabbing small objects. 
It is controlled using an Arduino Uno Microcontroller.

# Project Overview
The 3 DOF robotic arm is designed to have three primary axes of movement:

Base Rotation: Allows the entire arm to rotate left and right.
Shoulder Joint: Controls the vertical movement, enabling the arm to lift up or lower down.
Elbow Joint: Enables the extension and retraction of the arm, providing additional reach.
Each axis is powered by a dedicated servo motor, allowing precise control over the arm's movement.
